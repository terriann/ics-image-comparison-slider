## Building the Plugin

### Running Dev locally

What makes this different than a final build? This will compile your SASS and ES7 into CSS and JS while creating a `map` file but will not minify files.

`npm run dev`

## Running a final build

*It is recommended that this be done from the root of the plugin through the plugin's overall build process.*

`npm run build`
